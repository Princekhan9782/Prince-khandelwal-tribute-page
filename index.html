						As she slams the door in his drunken face,</p>
						<p>And now he stands outside
						And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool</p>
						<p>He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad,
						What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"</p>
						<p>Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
						And his tears fall and burn the garden green</p>
						<p>And so castles made of sand,
						Fall in the sea, eventually
						A little Indian brave who before he was ten,</p>
						<p>Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends,
						And he built a dream that when he grew up,</p>
						<p>He would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief
						Many moons passed and more the dream grew stronger,</p>
						<p>Until tomorrow, he would sing his first war song,
						And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,</p>
